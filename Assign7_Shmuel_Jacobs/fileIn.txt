1. Objectives This assignment will help you to:
• Understand how Binary Search Tree can be applied to problem solving
• Learn how to program using data structure Binary Search Tree
• Understand how Binary Search Tree works 
 
2. Overview  
You are going to write a Java application to implement a book index
using the data structure Binary Search Tree. First define a java class
named IndexTree , where each tree node has data fields to store a word,
the count of occurrence of that word in a document file, and the line
number for each occurrence. The line numbers of a word are stored using
an array or an ArrayList. Next define a java application class named
IndexTreeTest. In this class, you will do the following
• Create an empty IndexTree object
• Populate the nodes of the IndexTree object using index entries 
entered by the user or stored in a text file. These input entries must
be at random order.
• Display all index entries in the IndexTree object in the increasing
alphabetical order by performing an inorder traversal of this tree
• Allow the user to search the line numbers of a given word in the
IndexTree object. You must implement this IndexTree as a Binary Search
Tree data structure. Otherwise, you will not get any credit.
